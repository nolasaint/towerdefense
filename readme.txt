1. About

   This game was my final project for CS1331, an Introduction to Object-Oriented
       Programming class at the Georgia Institute of Technology. It plays like
       your standard Tower Defense game: you place towers which attack monsters
       following a path, and you lose health if they make it to the end.

2. Compile Instructions

   Can be compiled in Java 6 and above, may work in Java 5 but will be slower.

   Driver: TowerDefenseGame.java 
           **This is the file you run from command line after compiling the directory!**
